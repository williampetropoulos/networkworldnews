                      <h3 class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:normal;background:white;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
                      <p dir="ltr">As we all know, crime has always been a issue from the beginning of Man&rsquo;s existence Theft, Domestic Violence,&nbsp; and a whole slew of other Violent crimes. Sense Covid-19 started, and the stay at home orders, Violent crime has Sky rocketed. As families, extended and immediate are forced to stay indoors most of the time and being around each other more than families have in the last 100 years.&nbsp; My mother and Father never spent this much time around one another, ever! As people are losing their jobs, from companies closing or downsizing, it would take years of our average day to day life to accumulate this much time spent together with just a few months of staying at home, due to Covis-19. Of course, you will have your exceptions to the rule, including work from home parents and retired couples, but they would have already acclimated to time spent with each other. Like a mother raising her children, though mothers can get stressed over raising the kids sometimes, think of how much t=stress it would be for dad if all of a sudden he had to take over the kids and mom went to work.</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">Reports a Spousal abuse have increased 200% since April. Tempers have flared over many world issues,&nbsp; Presidential, Law Enforcement strong arming civilians, Job loss, you name itâ€¦ Then throw Covid-19 into the mix along with social distancing, store shelves empty&nbsp; and stay at home orders, and you have one volatile mix of events. Many people are 100% positive we are on the verge of another civil war and according to inside information, county emergency services and first responders, they have been on high alert for months, not just about civil war, but more immediate concerns like rioting, looting, vandalism. We have all been put aside due to this virus and all the side effects it has caused. I know for all of us here, it has been a real learning experience on human behavior and I believe we have entered a NEW NORM for society as a whole. Many health organizations and hospitals are quoting that masks will now be worn on a regular basis out in public and it will start a new fashion trend in faceware. We have started to see this trend on social media even now on TV commercials for face coverings in all styles and colors, gone are the days of plain old surgical masks for the public.</p>
                      <h2 dir="ltr">Law Enforcement and Covid-19</h2>
                      <p dir="ltr">To start with, during an outbreak of a deadly pathogen, Law Enforcement duties become tripled. Not only are they responsible to help Health and Government agencies control the spread of the virus, they are responsible for serving the community and still maintain law and order. This in turn puts the officers at high risk for Covid-19 infection due to their close contact with the public. The CDC-Centers For Disease Control and Prevention have set the guidelines for Law Enforcement safety during a Pandemic. Law Enforcement Agencies&nbsp; in much of the country have responded to this pandemic in many various ways, reassigning personnel to high traffic public areas, suspending training, calls, and community outreach programs, and suspending the issuing of citations for low-level crimes. implementing safety precautions, for all law enforcement officers, and limiting department facilities. COVID-19&nbsp; has exposed many obstacles for law enforcement, in the area of communication, and resource management. The enforcement of public health restrictions, as well as some changes to local crime patterns.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">Based on the early phase of Covid-19, their initial response and the unforeseen obstacles of the COVID-19 outbreak, the directions for future responses to pandemics have changed to ensure the safety and security of all law enforcement officers in the United States and the communities in which they serve.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">As the world, and every state and territory in the United States, and urban and rural jurisdictions grapple with the public health crisis and the economic repercussions of COVID-19,&nbsp; it has never been more important to assess the immediate effects of the pandemic on law enforcement and make drastic changes to prevent the outcome that has accrued during this pandemic. In the United States &ldquo;law enforcement&rsquo;s best practices and strategies currently being implemented to &ldquo;flatten the curve&rdquo;, ensure public safety, and to protect law enforcement officers.&rdquo; (Article PMC 7275851 ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                      <br />
                      <h3 dir="ltr">Law Enforcement: CDC recommended Response</h3>
                      <p dir="ltr">Considering the spread of Covid-19 and person to person contact the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention have set the basic rules to help protect law enforcement from contracting COVID-19 through respiratory droplets, all law enforcement is at a very high risk of exposure due to close contact with the public. The guidelines can be downloaded here at this link&nbsp; (CDC,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR8">2020</a>).&nbsp;</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines&nbsp;</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">1) social distancing (maintaining a distance of six-feet from other individuals to avoid exposure),&nbsp;</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">2) maintaining proper hand hygiene (washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">3) avoiding touching one&rsquo;s face with unwashed hands.&nbsp;</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">The Problem is most Law enforcement officers cannot carry out their duties without being in close proximity to and don't always have access to sanitation supplies out in the field. LEO&rsquo;s ( Law Enforcement Officers) who work in correctional facilities are at extreme risk of exposure of contracting and spreading Covid-19 due to the facilities inclosed design. Information from -(Maruschak, Sabol, Potter, Reid, &amp; Cramer<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR24"> 2009</a>).&nbsp;</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">Over 2000 Law enforcement officers had tested positive to Covid-19 by April, 2020, most of them in the New York City&nbsp; area , with thousands more law enforcement officers reported having contact with individuals who had tested positive for Covid-19. &nbsp; information from- (Cave &amp; Dahir<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR7"> 2020</a>; NPF,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR28"> 2020</a>). Taking this into account, there is a large concern for the wellbeing of LEO&rsquo;s and their families. Report from -Schuppe<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR37"> 2020</a>).</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">Aside from the regular dangers of keeping the peace and the danger of close contact with the public in general, the COVID-19 pandemic has the threat of officers being intentionally&nbsp; contaminated. This past March the Federal Bureau of Investigation alerted local law enforcement agencies that radical extremists, such as white supremacists groups have asked members who are COVID-19 positive to spread the virus to law enforcement officers&nbsp; Via body fluids by breathing and sneezing on them as they walk down the street - more information (Margolin<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR22"> 2020</a>).&nbsp;</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">Many officers have reported incidents of being sneezed, spit and coughed on by individuals claiming they are positive for Covid-19 virus - report link (Bates<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR3"> 2020</a>).&nbsp;</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">To decrease the risk to law enforcement many agencies have started working remotely&nbsp; if possible (Bates<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR3"> 2020</a>; NPF<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR28"> 2020</a>).</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">To prevent&nbsp; infection, the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention have designed protective recommendations for all first responders, such as law enforcement officers, that come into contact with the public and or individuals infected with COVID-19. The CDC recommendations include:&nbsp;</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">wearing PPE, gloves, mask and eyewear as well as disposable gowns and overalls, also N95 masks or higher, that are approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH); if N-95 respirators are not available, wear a facemask as a alternative until N95 supplies are restored. The CDC also recommends that all officers who come in contact with individuals while detaining them or arresting them should clean and disinfect all gear before reusing it.</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">Follow the procedure outlined by the CDC to decontaminate the gear, and dispose of any PPE, and follow CDC outlined procedure to launder clothing. If your agencies and law enforcement officers follow these guidelines, the CDC estimates that the health risk for law enforcement personnel would remain lower - link report&nbsp; (CDC,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR8"> 2020</a>).</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">The Vera Institute of Justice - see link - (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR41">2020</a>) also has recommended guidelines for first responders to help further prevent exposure to Covid-19 or any other pathogen. Their guidelines focus on the prevention of contagion in several ways, suggesting that agencies should:&nbsp;</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">1. Ensure 911 dispatchers divert calls-for health services when a police response is not necessary;.</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">2. Issue temporary directives to release individuals on a citation, ticket and summons that have committed a felony or pose a risk to the public.</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">3. Suspend protocols that place people in custody (limiting enforcement of bench warrants, and arrest warrants, as well as parole violations.</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">4. limit response to low-risk incidents and focus on critical incidents and community health needs (such as traffic stops, noise complaints, etc.</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">5. limit the department's contact with officers who are in direct contact with visitors.</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">6. Use online reporting options for public complaints and police reports.</p>
                      <p dir="ltr">7. Increase cleaning and disinfecting of patrol cars, precincts, stations, and other high-traffic areas. Report link&nbsp; (Vera Institute of Justice<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7275851/#CR41"> 2020</a>,).</p>
